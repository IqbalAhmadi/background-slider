# Background Slider

The Background Slider project is a web-based application that allows users to view a collection of images in a slideshow format. The unique feature of this slider is that each image is displayed with a reflection of itself as the background. Users can navigate through the images by clicking on either the right or left arrow.

## Technologies Used

The project is built using the following technologies:

- HTML: Used for creating the structure and content of the web page.
- CSS: Used for styling the elements and creating the reflection effect.
- JavaScript: Used for implementing the slideshow functionality and handling user interactions.

## Usage

- When the web page loads, the first image in the slideshow will be displayed.
- To view the next image, click on the right arrow button.
- To view the previous image, click on the left arrow button.
- The image displayed will have a reflection of itself as the background, creating a visually appealing effect.

## Customization

If you wish to customize the Background Slider, you can modify the following files:

- `index.html`: You can add or remove images by editing the HTML markup.
- `styles.css`: You can modify the CSS styles to change the appearance of the slider or the reflection effect.
- `script.js`: You can modify the JavaScript code to add new functionality or customize the slideshow behavior.
